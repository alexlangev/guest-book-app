## Overview

The Guestbook app is a blockchain-based project built on the Goerli testnet of Ethereum. This app allows users to sign the guestbook using their public address, a name of their choice, and a short message limited to 160 characters. Each signature is timestamped and unique, preventing users from signing more than once. This project was created purely for learning purposes and showcases my ability to write build a simple decentralized application.

## Objectives

- Put to practice my Solidity fundamentals by writing and publishing my first smart contract.

- Write unit tests for the smart contract.

- Build a simple frontend.

- Read data from the blockchain without connecting any wallet.

- Write data to the blockchain after connecting a wallet.

## Built with

The smart contract written in Solidity the scripting language of the Ethereum blockchain.

The smart contract test and deployment was done with the Hardhat framework.

The frontend is built with React and Next.js.

I used the ethers.js library to connect the frontend to the blockchain.

I decided to style the site using vanilla CSS since Next.Js 13 doesn't fully support Styled-components my favorite CSS solution.

The site is hosted on Vercel.
