# Guestbook app

## Objectives

- Write my first smart contract in Solidity
- Publish it on the goerli testnet
- Link a Next/React web app to it
- Enable user to read data from the blockchain without connecting any wallet
- Enable users to write to the blockchain after connecting their own wallet and update the webapp
- Create a striking hacker/fallout theme


## Front

Using Next 13 but kept the pages directory. Styled components doesnt seem to be fully supported by next13 and so I went with vanilla CSS since it's a small project.
